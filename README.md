This PHP script creates a system to enable a website visitor to register as a member and set up an account with their own password, and even upload their own photos and files.

A MySQL database table must be set-up following the schema shown in DB_Schema_Member_Accounts.png

A connection to this MySQL database must then be added to mysql_connect.php
